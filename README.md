# ObjectDiameterInImageUsingMATLAB-
Measuring objects within an image or frame can be an important capability
for many applications where computer vision is required instead of making 
physical measurements. This application note has basic step-by-step algorithm 
for isolating a desired object and measuring its diameter. Through this application
one can import an image, segment the image in order to isolate the desired object
from its background and then use the MATLAB functions that come with the
Image Processing Toolbox to determine the objects diameter. 

Requirements: 
Windows XP or better, Intel or AMD x86 processor, 4 GB Disk Space, 
2048 MB RAM at least, hardware accelerated graphics card supporting 
OpenGL 3.3 with 1 GB GPU memory, MATLAB 2014a, Image Processing Toolbox .


This project has step by step excetion which includes
1)	Import Image 

2)	Segment Image 

3)	Segmentation Continued (Remove Noise) 

4)	Measuring Image 

5)	Result
